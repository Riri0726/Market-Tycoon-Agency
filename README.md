Market Tycoon: Agency Edition (Turn-Based)

Version: 2.1 (Day Cycle Update)

Genre: Turn-Based Management / Simulation

Platform: Web (HTML5)

1. Game Overview

You play as the CEO of a digital marketing agency. Instead of creating content yourself, you manage a roster of Clients (Producers). Your goal is to sign clients to temporary contracts, manage their daily output, and maximize revenue before their contracts expire.

The game operates on a Day/Turn Cycle. You have a "Planning Phase" to do business, followed by a "Work Day" simulation where revenue is generated.

2. Core Gameplay Loop

Phase 1: Planning (The Morning)

At the start of every new day, the market generates 3 to 5 new Prospects.

Review Leads: You can see the name, "Taste" (Vibe), and Contract Length (e.g., 3 Days) of each prospect.

Pitching: You attempt to sign prospects by matching a keyword to their Taste.

Success: They join your Client Roster.

Failure: They reject you and leave immediately.

Time Limit: Unsold prospects expire at the end of the day. You cannot "save" them for tomorrow.

Phase 2: Work Day (The Simulation)

Once you are done signing clients, you click "Start Work Day".

Duration: The day runs for 10 seconds of real-time simulation.

Action: Your Active Clients will automatically post content to the Live Feed.

Revenue: Posts generate Views. You earn money based on View Milestones.

Restriction: You cannot pitch new clients while the work day is active.

Phase 3: End of Day (The Reset)

After the 10-second simulation:

Contract Aging: All active clients lose 1 Day from their contract.

Churn: Clients with 0 days remaining leave the agency.

Lead Expiry: Any prospects you didn't pitch to are removed.

New Day: The day counter advances, and a fresh batch of prospects is generated for the next morning.

3. Economy & Monetization

3.1 Revenue Model

Payout: You earn $0.50 for every 100 Views accumulated across all posts.

The Revenue Cap (Crucial): * Every single post is capped at 100 Views.

Once a post hits 100 Views, it stops generating money forever.

Strategy: Since individual posts have limited earning potential ($0.50 max), your success depends on the volume of posts your clients generate per day.

3.2 Costs & Upkeep

Scouting: Free (Automated daily).

Pitching: Free (But risk of failure).

Starting Capital: $100.00.

Day Counter: Tracks how long your agency has survived.

Progress Bar: Visual timer for the 10-second work day.

Red Border: Contract expires tonight (1 Day Left).

Post Cards:

Blue Text: Earning revenue.

Grey Text ("MAX REVENUE"): Capped at 100 views. No longer earning.

6. Strategic Tips

Pitch Everyone: Since daily prospects disappear if not used, try to pitch to every available lead in the Planning Phase.

Watch the Churn: If you have 5 clients and 3 of them have "1 Day Left," you need to aggressively sign new clients today, or your revenue will crash tomorrow.

Volume is King: Because of the $0.50 cap per post, a single "viral" post isn't possible. You need a full roster of clients spamming the feed to make significant money.
